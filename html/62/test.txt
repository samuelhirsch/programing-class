i have 6 comments about my test(I'm not sure that everything is a problem but I wrote them all down...)
1) my nav-bar and my footer i made -1px on both sides( the left one i 
remember that i didÂ on purpose because on the pic. it was seemed to me that it is -1px )email

2)i didnt make sure that my table is not taking up the hole width;

3)by the input email i forgot to put "name=email"

4)When I worked on my page that when I'm pressing on the links ,the page  should not go under the NAV bar  
(What you showed on the end of the class)I messed a little bit up with my coding 
(And it's even not working so well on all sizes of screens)

5)i Didn't make sure that the "height" of the images should be the same "height"

6) My form is displayed Gray but I didn't display it into another Container
